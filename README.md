## Linux in the real life...

[Linux sucks!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDC924p3tjDCid6Jh5QCc0ro33mwHmkWZ) Sometimes it can be very annoying so my goal is to show you how to tame this beast and make it work for you, not the other way around

You will find on this repository a few md files which will give you some guidance, useful tips, a step by step instalation of Arch Linux, some videos about how to troubleshoot and fix common problems, some shell scripting, ansible automation and more to come

I will try to make these tips distro agnostic and I will focus on CentOS, Debian and OpenSUSE for Servers and Arch and Fedora for Desktop
